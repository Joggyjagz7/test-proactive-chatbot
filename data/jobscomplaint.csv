Shortly after moving in things such as doors and drawers started falling off as well as handles and hinges. For the last two years we have just got on with it and not complained as we are grateful to be in a position where we have a roof over our heads but the last week two things have happened regarding the kitchen. Firstly my seven year old son was getting a spoon out of the cutlery drawer and the face of the drawer fell off and the actual drawer feel apart spilling the contents of the cutlery drawer all over the place. Thankfully my son was not harmed but this could easily of been the drawer to the left that contains sharp knives etc. Secondly where our oven is located in our kitchen the plynth under the oven has given way and fallen to pieces, when the oven is on you can literally feel the heat coming out of the missing section of the carcass of the unit. I have also noticed the legs underneath the carcass that houses the oven have snapped/come off/ were never there. Obviously this is a fire risk as if the oven gives way while it is on it could cause a fire not to mention it is also a health and safety risk as someone could get burnt if they reach onto the missing bit of the unit under the oven. This coupled with the fact that four drawer faces are now not on most of the handles to the doors are now gone and a lot of hinges are missing. I know that it is an old kitchen and that these things happen with time as nothing is built to last forever especially now days, Receive SMS:No, Receive Email:No, Contacted for Survey:No, Out of Hours:No, Call On Route:Yes",1 PPL A2D Team,Keelee-Weddis,Hamer,8 Russell Court,########,OS: Waiting to Start,143826,SM6 8QS,A2D - Region 2,A2D Carpenter,Standard,Cancelled,,,Flat,Direct,0,0,,No
